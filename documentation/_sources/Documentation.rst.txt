.. VectorNav SDK documentation overview file


VectorNav Software Development Kit
##################################

The VectorNav SDK provides a comprehensive software interface to communicate with, configure, and parse the outputs of any VectorNav unit. It contains complete protocol definitions for VectorNav register specifications, commands, and measurement outputs, matching the latest interface control document (ICD). Both synchronous and asynchronous messages are supported through a polling-based architecture. 

The base SDK is written in C++17 and includes language wrappers for Python and CLI. The CLI SDK is used to generate a .NET-accessible dll file, available in the .NET library, that can be used to interface with VectorNav units in MATLAB or C#. The VectorNav SDK is designed to provide maximum flexibility across any operating system or embedded environment. Specific features, capabilities, style guides, and usage examples can be found in the documentation for each language.

Getting Started
===============

The best way to validate the download, tool chain, and basic hardware compatibility of the VNSDK is by running the Getting Started example. Additional informaiton on installing each of the libraries and running the Geting Started example can be found on the Getting Started documentation page in each language.

USB Cable Driver Requirements
-----------------------------
VectorNav's standard USB cable uses an FTDI serial-to-USB converter chip. Some systems may require manual driver installation if the device cannot be detected. If your computer cannot locate the VectorNav unit when connected via USB, you may need to install the FTDI Virtual COM Port (VCP) driver, which can be downloaded directly from FTDI's `website <https://ftdichip.com/drivers/vcp-drivers/>`_. Once the driver is properly installed, your VectorNav unit should appear as a COM port (Windows) or serial device (Linux/macOS) and be ready for communication through the SDK.

Plugins
=======

Each language in the VectorNav SDK contains a collection of plugins that provide additional functionality for the user, such as logging data from a Vector Nav unit or updating the firmware installed on the device. General information on each plugin can be found below. Specific details on using each plugin can be found on the Plugins doumentation pages in each language.

Calibration (BETA)
------------------
.. warning::
	This plugin is currently in *BETA* and may be subject to interface changes in the future.

The Calibration plugin provides embedded versions of the most common user calibrations performed on VectorNav units, which are used to optimize sensor performance. This plugin supports various calibration methodologies including accelerometer and gyroscope bias calibrations, magnetometer hard and soft iron (HSI) calibrations, and routines for sensor alignment calibration. The plugin includes tools for calibration data collection, analysis, and coefficient generation, with support for both automated and manual calibration procedures.

.. note::
   Access to the Calibration Plugin requires a license agreement; it will not be provided until the agreement is signedâ€”please email VectorNav 
   Support at support@vectornav.com to initiate the licensing process.

Data Export (BETA)
------------------

.. warning::
	This plugin is currently in *BETA* and may be subject to interface changes in the future.

The Data Export plugin allows the user to export data into a variety of standard formats including CSV, TXT, and RINEX files. This plugin can process data from either previously logged binary files or data directly from a VectorNav unit. Additionally, it can handle outputting to multiple different formats at once.

Firmware Programmer
-------------------
The Firmware Programmer plugin contains everything necessary to update the firmware on a VectorNav unit. This plugin enables users to perform firmware updates without the need for VectorNav's Control Center GUI or a custom embedded updater and has the ability to accept both VNX and VNXML files.

.. note::
   All firmware updates must be performed through the main communication port (UART-1) with an established connection before an update can occur. Please reach out to support@vectornav.com to obtain the VNX or VNXML file(s) for your specific sensor.

Logger
------
The Logger plugin is a lightweight plugin that allows users to easily log all bytes received from a VectorNav unit to a binary file without the need to parse the packets. This plugin can be used in conjunction with the Data Export plugin, which allows users to export the binary file that was logged into a CSV, TXT, or RINEX file.

Math
----
.. warning::
	This plugin is currently in *BETA* in the Python and CLI libraries and may be subject to interface changes in the future.

The Math plugin extends the vector and matrix functions available in the SDK with additional data conversion utilities and expanded linear algebra functions, providing a comprehensive mathematical toolkit for processing data from a VectorNav unit.

Register Scan
-------------
The Register Scan plugin provides functionality to load a previously saved configuration file onto a VectorNav unit or to save the current configuration of a VectorNav unit into a configuration file. It can save any subset of configuration registers, and can optionally save only user-edited values. It contains prewritten methods to work with XML files (which are interoperable with Control Center) and ASCII files, or it can accept any runtime, user-defined format.

ROS2
----
The ROS2 plugin facilitates integration of VectorNav sensors into ROS2 ecosystems. This plugin automatically configures the connected VectorNav device using an included YAML configuration file and publishes measurements to custom topics. Each binary output group has its own message type and can be subscribed to independently.
