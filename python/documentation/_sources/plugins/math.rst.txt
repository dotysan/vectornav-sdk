Math (*BETA*)
#############

The Math plugin includes several classes, functions, and universal constants that are available to the user for various mathematical tasks. 

.. warning::
	This plugin is currently in *BETA* and may be subject to interface changes in the future.

Usage
=====
This plugin is contained in a single :class:`~vectornav.Math` submodule, found in the PyMath file, but split into multiple sections based on the type of mathematical task performed:

* Temperature and angle conversions are located in the `Conversions` section of the file.
* Conversions that are related to attitude are located in the `AttitudeMath` section of the file. This includes transformations between the different attitude representations, such as the direction cosine matrix (DCM), quaternion, and yaw-pitch-roll angles. Additionally, quaternion propagation and methods for calculating attitude from inertial sensor data can be found in this file.
* Any calculations related to position and velocity can be found in the `PosVelMath` section of the file. This includes course and speed over ground calculations and the conversions between Earth-centered, Earth-fixed (ECEF) and latitude, longitude, altitude (LLA) coordinates.
* All math related to linear algebra can be found in the `LinearAlgebra` section of the file. Some helpful functions located here include the inverse, transpose, dot product, and cross product methods.

.. .. note::

..     While not part of the Math plugin, matrix operator overloads along with the identity and null functions are provided in the :ref:`Matrix <file_include_vectornav_Matrix.hpp>` file.

API
===

The Python API for the Math plugin is modeled from the C++ API which can be found here:
:ref:`Math <plugins_cpp:namespace_VN__Math>`
