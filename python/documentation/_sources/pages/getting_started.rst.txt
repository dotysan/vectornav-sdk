Getting Started
###############

Requirements
============

* Python >= 3.8 64-bit
* MSVC >= 2015 on Windows OS
* pybind11

Tested OS
=========
The Python SDK is continually tested on the following hardware/Python combinations:

* Windows 10 : Python 3.11
* Windows 11 : Python 3.11
* Ubuntu 20.04 : Python 3.8

Installation
============

To build and install the VectorNav Python library run the following command from the root folder:

.. code-block:: console

    pip install ./python

.. tip::
    If an installation error occurs, pip may need to be upgraded before installing the VectorNav Python library - pip versions v22 or newer should have no issues building the library. To update pip, run the following command::

        python -m pip install --upgrade pip 

    For applications using a version of pip older than v22 that do not wish to upgrade pip, use the following command instead to build and install the VectorNav Python library::

        pip install ./python --use-feature=in-tree-build

    If the installation error persists after upgrading pip or using the alternate command to build the library, reach out to the VectorNav support team for further assistance.

.. admonition:: Installation on Ubuntu 20.04 or Older

    To build and install the VectorNav Python library on Ubuntu 20.04 or older, run the following command from the root folder:

    .. code-block:: console

        pip install -e ./python

.. admonition:: Installation on Ubuntu 18.04

    If installing the VectorNav Python library on Ubuntu 18.04, an updated version of GCC must be installed as the library is not compatible with the default GCC version (v7.4.0) shipped on this version of Ubuntu. Installing GCC version v9 is recommended, which is typically accessible as **gcc-9** and **g++-9**. To install the required tools and dependencies, run the following commands:

    .. code-block:: python

        sudo add-apt-repository ppa:ubuntu-toolchain-r/test
        sudo apt update
        sudo apt install gcc-9 g++-9
        sudo apt install python3-pip
        pip3 install pybind11

    When installing the new GCC version, the following lines need to be added to the **setup.py** file after **import platform** where <compiler> would be replaced with the user's chosen compiler.

    .. code-block:: python

        import os
        os.environ["CC"] = "<compiler>"
        os.environ["CXX"] = "<compiler>"

    In **setup.py**, the libraries line should be changed to:

    .. code-block:: python

        libraries = 'stdc++fs'

    To build and install the VectorNav Python library on Ubuntu 18.04, run the following command from the root folder:

    .. code-block:: console

        pip3 install -e ./python

Run the Getting Started Example
===============================

The best way to validate the installation is by running the Getting Started example located in the ./python/examples/getting_started directory. Notice you can run this file by passing the COM port as a command line argument or by hardcoding the value inside the **getting_started.py** example file. The VectorNav USB adapter will show up in Windows as **COMXX**, where **XX** is the COM port number, and in Linux as **/dev/ttyUSBX**, where **X** is a number (usually 0). The example can now be run using:

.. code-block:: console

    python ./python/examples/getting_started/getting_started.py

or using the optional command line argument:

.. code-block:: console

    python ./python/examples/getting_started/getting_started.py your_com_port_here
