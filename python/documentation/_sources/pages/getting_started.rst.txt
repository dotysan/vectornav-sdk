Getting Started
###############

Requirements
============

* Python >= 3.8 64-bit
* MSVC >= 2015 on Windows OS
* pybind11

Tested OS
=========
The Python SDK is continually tested on the following hardware/Python combinations:

* Windows 10 : Python 3.11
* Windows 11 : Python 3.11
* Ubuntu 20.04 : Python 3.8

Installation
============

To build and install the VectorNav Python library run the following command from the root folder:

.. code-block:: console

    pip install ./python

.. tip::
    If an installation error occurs, pip may need to be upgraded.
    Run the command::

        python -m pip install --upgrade pip 

    After updating pip, try to reinstall the VNSDK python package to see if the error still occurs.
    If so, reach out to VectorNav support for further assistance.

Run the Getting Started Example
===============================

The best way to validate the installation is by running the Getting Started example located in the ./python/examples/getting_started directory. Notice you can run this file by passing the COM port as a command line argument or by hardcoding the value inside the **getting_started.py** example file. The VectorNav USB adapter will show up in Windows as **COMXX**, where **XX** is the COM port number, and in Linux as **/dev/ttyUSBX**, where **X** is a number (usually 0). The example can now be run using:

.. code-block:: console

    python ./python/examples/getting_started/getting_started.py

or using the optional command line argument:

.. code-block:: console

    python ./python/examples/getting_started/getting_started.py your_com_port_here
