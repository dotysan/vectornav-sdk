    This data export example walks through the Python usage of the SDK to export data from a VectorNav unit to a CSV file.

    This example will achieve the following:
    1. Instantiate a Sensor object and use it to connect to the VectorNav unit
    2. Create an ExportCsv object
    3. Add a subscriber to all binary and ASCII packets
    4. Log data from the VectorNav unit
    5. Disconnect from the VectorNav unit
