    2. Instantiate a Sensor object and use it to connect to the VectorNav unit
    3. Save all non-default values from the VectorNav unit as specified
    4. Disconnect from the VectorNav unit

    # this call as any errors encountered could mean that the settings previously configured were not able
    # to be reapplied onto the unit. If performing a Restore Factory Settings command is not desired, the
    # RegisterScan.saveConfiguration() method should instead be used to save the current configuration of
    # a VectorNav unit.
