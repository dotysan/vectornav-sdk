    This example demonstrates how to send commands without blocking, validating each command was received correctly
    with different types of commands. For more information on non-blocking commands, please refer to the 'Advanced Functionality'
    section of the documentation.

    This example will achieve the following:
    1. Instantiate a Sensor object and use it to connect to the VectorNav unit
    2. Configure the asynchronous ASCII output to YPR at 100 Hz
    3. Send generic command (Known Magnetic Disturbance command)
    4. Wait and check response from the unit
    5. Output VNYPR at 100 Hz and send velocity aiding commands at 10 Hz for 5 seconds:
        5.1. Check if a valid response has been received from the velocity aiding command
        5.2. Print response and send new command
    6. Disconnect from the VectorNav unit'
