####

The Math plugin includes several classes, functions, and universal constants that are available to the user for various mathematical tasks. 

Usage
=====
This plugin is contained in a single :ref:`Math <namespace_VN__Math>` namespace but split into multiple files based on the type of mathematical task performed:

* Temperature and angle conversions are located in the :ref:`Conversions <file_plugins_Math_vectornav_Conversions.hpp>` file.
* Conversions that are related to attitude are located in the :ref:`AttitudeMath <file_plugins_Math_vectornav_AttitudeMath.hpp>` file. This includes transformations between the different attitude representations, such as the direction cosine matrix (DCM), quaternion, and yaw-pitch-roll angles. Additionally, quaternion propagation and methods for calculating attitude from inertial sensor data can be found in this file.
* Any calculations related to position and velocity can be found in the :ref:`PosVelMath <file_plugins_Math_vectornav_PosVelMath.hpp>` file. This includes course and speed over ground calculations and the conversions between Earth-centered, Earth-fixed (ECEF) and latitude, longitude, altitude (LLA) coordinates.
* All math related to linear algebra can be found in the :ref:`LinearAlgebra <file_plugins_Math_vectornav_LinearAlgebra.hpp>` file. Some helpful functions located here include the inverse, transpose, dot product, and cross product methods.
* Linear least squares solvers and utilities are located in the :ref:`LinearLeastSquares <file_plugins_Math_vectornav_LinearLeastSquares.hpp>` file. This includes the :class:`~VN::Math::LinearLeastSquares` class for solving systems, along with result containers and error handling.
* Mathematical routines related to eigen decomposition can be found in the :ref:`EigenDecomposition <file_plugins_Math_vectornav_EigenDecomposition.hpp>` file. This includes the :class:`~VN::Math::EigenDecomposition` class for operations like extracting eigenvalues and eigenvectors, which is used in linear system solvers and other numerical routines.

.. note::

    While not part of the Math plugin, matrix operator overloads along with the identity and null functions are provided in  :class:`~VN::Matrix`.
